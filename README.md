Building an Admin Dashboard layout using CSS grid for The Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS Course

A great exercise building this entire layout using only CSS grid! This is my little play on the given dashboard, a fake contractor app called Fieldify.

Some points were frustrating as they would have been easily dealt with using flex, but nothing a little CSS magic couldn't handle. 

I will definitely be using grid in the future, in particular for grid-like layouts such as this one.

Where I found it would have been useful to use Flex here, was within some of the content boxes themselves (cards, trending, announcements). But that just shows you can also get it done in Grid.
